# Workshop 4

By: Warren Smith

## Emphasis

The study of *computing and information systems* is central to our understanding of how the world processes, manages and communicates information using _digital technologies_.  As a student, you learn to build and use computing and information systems.  You learn to see things from a broader systems perspective and to develop integrated solutions that meet the needs of your users.  And you learn to appreciate the far-reaching cultural, ethical, and legal impact of digital systems.

## Strong

It is hard to imagine a world without **computing and information systems**.  It is even harder to imagine our world in another 60 years.  New software products and new technologies continue to change our landscape almost daily.  Even the products and technologies of other fields could not be developed without the support of computing and information systems.  It is arguably the __most revolutionary field of our lifetime__ and we extend a warm welcome to be part of our adventure.
